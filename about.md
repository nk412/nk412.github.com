I'm a big data software developer based in the beautiful city of **Cambridge, UK**. I was born in *India*, grew up in *Dubai*, and have been living in the UK for a few years now. I like solving problems, but I like writing code to solve them more. **I work with large datasets on a distributed computing platform.** I am a big fan of learning new things, technical or otherwise. I'm also an avid PC gamer. When I'm not in front of a keyboard, I'm usually outside travelling, writing, or being a hobbyist magician.

I graduated with a first class *MSc in Advanced Computing*, specializing in *machine learning & high performance computing* from the **University of Bristol, UK** in 2012, before which I recieved a first class honors degree in *BE Computer Science* from **BITS, Pilani - Dubai, UAE** in 2011.
