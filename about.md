I'm a software engineer based in the beautiful city of **Cambridge, UK**. Born in India, I grew up in Dubai, UAE, and have been in the UK for a few years now.

Currently, I am an Analytics Developer at *[Jagex](http://www.jagex.com)*, where **I work with large datasets on a distributed computing platform.** I like solving problems, building things that work, and learning new stuff, both technical and otherwise. When not in front of a keyboard, you can usually find me outside travelling, writing, or entertaining people as a hobbyist magician.

I graduated with a first class *MSc in Advanced Computing*, specializing in *Machine Learning, Data Mining & High Performance Computing* from the **University of Bristol, UK** in 2012, before which I recieved a first class honors degree in *BE Computer Science* from **BITS Pilani - Dubai, UAE**.
