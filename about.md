I'm a big data software engineer based in the beautiful city of **Cambridge, UK**. Born in India, I grew up in Dubai and moved to the UK a few years ago.

I like solving problems, and I like writing code to solve them even more. **I work with large datasets on a distributed computing platform.** I'm a big fan of learning new things, technical and otherwise. When I'm not in front of a keyboard, I'm usually outside travelling, writing, or entertaining people as a hobbyist magician.

I graduated with a first class *MSc in Advanced Computing*, specializing in *Machine Learning & High Performance Computing* from the **University of Bristol, UK** in 2012, before which I recieved a first class honors degree in *BE Computer Science* from **BITS Pilani - Dubai, UAE**, in 2011.
